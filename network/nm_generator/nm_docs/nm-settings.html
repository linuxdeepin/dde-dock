<p>
          NetworkManager is based on a concept of connection profiles, sometimes referred to as
          connections only. These connection profiles contain a network configuration. When
          NetworkManager activates a connection profile on a network device the configuration will
          be applied and an active network connection will be established. Users are free to create
          as many connection profiles as they see fit. Thus they are flexible in having various network
          configurations for different networking needs. The connection profiles are handled by
          NetworkManager via <span class="emphasis"><em>settings service</em></span> and are exported on D-Bus
          (<span class="emphasis"><em>/org/freedesktop/NetworkManager/Settings/&lt;num&gt;</em></span> objects).
          The conceptual objects can be described as follows:

                  A specific, encapsulated, independent group of settings describing
                  all the configuration required to connect to a specific network.
                  It is referred to by a unique identifier called the UUID. A connection
                  is tied to a one specific device type, but not necessarily a specific
                  hardware device. It is composed of one or more <span class="emphasis"><em>Settings</em></span>
                  objects.

                  described in the tables below. Keys are also referred to as properties.
                  Developers can find the setting objects and their properties in the libnm-util
                  sources. Look for the <code class="function">class_init</code> functions near the bottom of

              The settings and properties shown in tables below list all available connection
              configuration options. However, note that not all settings are applicable to all
              connection types. NetworkManager provides a command-line tool <span class="emphasis"><em>nmcli</em></span>
              that allows direct configuration of the settings and properties according to a connection
              profile type. <span class="emphasis"><em>nmcli</em></span> connection editor has also a built-in
              <span class="emphasis"><em>describe</em></span> command that can display description of particular settings
              and properties of this page.

In general, for the "auto" method, properties such as "dns" and "routes" specify information that is added on to the information returned from automatic configuration.  The "ignore-auto-routes" and "ignore-auto-dns" properties modify this behavior. For methods that imply no upstream network, such as "shared" or "link-local", these properties must be empty. For IPv4 method "shared", the IP subnet can be configured by adding one manual IPv4 address or otherwise 10.42.x.0/24 is chosen.</td>

This property allows to specify that certain bits are fixed. Note that the least significant bit of the first MAC address will always be unset to create a unicast MAC address. If the property is NULL, it is eligible to be overwritten by a default connection setting. If the value is still NULL or an empty string, the default is to create a locally-administered, unicast MAC address. If the value contains one MAC address, this address is used as mask. The set bits of the mask are to be filled with the current MAC address of the device, while the unset bits are subject to randomization. Setting "FE:FF:FF:00:00:00" means to preserve the OUI of the current MAC address and only randomize the lower 3 bytes using the "random" or "stable" algorithm. If the value contains one additional MAC address after the mask, this address is used instead of the current MAC address to fill the bits that shall not be randomized. For example, a value of "FE:FF:FF:00:00:00 68:F7:28:00:00:00" will set the OUI of the MAC address to 68:F7:28, while the lower bits are randomized. A value of "02:00:00:00:00:00 00:00:00:00:00:00" will create a fully scrambled globally-administered, burned-in MAC address. If the value contains more then one additional MAC addresses, one of them is chosen randomly. For example, "02:00:00:00:00:00 00:00:00:00:00:00 02:00:00:00:00:00" will create a fully scrambled MAC address, randomly locally or globally administered.</td>
