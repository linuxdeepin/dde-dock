</div>
<div class="refsect1">
<a name="id-1.2.9.5"></a><h2>Description</h2>
<p>
      The NetworkManager daemon attempts to make networking
      configuration and operation as painless and automatic as
      possible by managing the primary network connection and other
      network interfaces, like Ethernet, WiFi, and Mobile Broadband
      devices.  NetworkManager will connect any network device when a
      connection for that device becomes available, unless that
      behavior is disabled.  Information about networking is exported
      via a D-Bus interface to any interested application, providing a
      rich API with which to inspect and control network settings and
      operation.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="refsect1">
<a name="id-1.2.9.6"></a><h2>Dispatcher scripts</h2>
<p>
      NetworkManager will execute scripts in the
      /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d directory or subdirectories in
      alphabetical order in response to network events.  Each script should
      be a regular executable file owned by root.  Furthermore, it must not be
      writable by group or other, and not setuid.
    </p>
<p>
      Each script receives two arguments, the first being the interface name of the
      device an operation just happened on, and second the action. For device actions,
      the interface is the name of the kernel interface suitable for IP configuration.
      Thus it is either VPN_IP_IFACE, DEVICE_IP_IFACE, or DEVICE_IFACE, as applicable.
      For the <code class="varname">hostname</code> and <code class="varname">connectivity-change</code>
      actions it is always "none".
    </p>
<p>The actions are:</p>

        yet fully activated.  Scripts acting on this event must be placed or
        symlinked into the /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/pre-up.d directory,
        and NetworkManager will wait for script execution to complete before
        indicating to applications that the interface is fully activated.

        directory, and NetworkManager will wait for script execution to complete
        before disconnecting the interface from its network.  Note that this
        event is not emitted for forced disconnections, like when carrier is
        lost or a wireless signal fades.  It is only emitted when there is
        an opportunity to cleanly handle a network disconnection event.

<p>
      Dispatcher scripts are run one at a time, but asynchronously from the main
      NetworkManager process, and will be killed if they run for too long. If your script
      might take arbitrarily long to complete, you should spawn a child process and have the
      parent return immediately. Scripts that are symbolic links pointing inside the
      /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/no-wait.d/ directory are run immediately, without
      waiting for the termination of previous scripts, and in parallel. Also beware that
      once a script is queued, it will always be run, even if a later event renders it
      obsolete. (Eg, if an interface goes up, and then back down again quickly, it is
      possible that one or more "up" scripts will be run after the interface has gone down.)

          configuration such as addresses or routes.

          Create an udev rule that sets this property to prevent NetworkManager

<colgroup>
<col align="left" valign="top">
<col>
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><p><span class="term"><code class="varname">SIGHUP</code></span></p></td>
<td><p>
          The signal causes a reload of NetworkManager's configuration.
          Note that not all configuration parameters can be changed at
          runtime and therefore some changes may be applied only after
          the next restart of the daemon.
          A SIGHUP also involves further reloading actions, like doing
          a DNS update and restarting the DNS plugin. The latter can be
          useful for example when using the dnsmasq plugin and changing
          its configuration in /etc/NetworkManager/dnsmasq.d. However,
          it also means this will shortly interrupt name resolution.
          In the future, there may be further actions added.
          A SIGHUP means to update NetworkManager configuration and reload
          everything that is supported. Note that this does not reload
          connections from disk. For that there is a D-Bus API and
          nmcli's reload action

            The signal forces a rewrite of DNS configuration. Contrary to
            SIGHUP, this does not restart the DNS plugin and will not interrupt
            name resolution.
            In the future, further actions may be added. A SIGUSR1
            means to write out data like resolv.conf, or refresh a cache.
            It is a subset of what is done for SIGHUP without reloading
            configuration from disk.

      An alternative to a signal to reload configuration is the Reload D-Bus call.
      It allows for more fine-grained selection of what to reload, it only returns
      after the reload is complete, and it is guarded by PolicyKit.

      The following environment variables are supported to help

      <code class="option">--no-daemon</code> option (thus echoing PPP and DHCP

    </p>
<p>
      <code class="option">NM_PPP_DEBUG</code>: When set to anything, causes
